## Interpreter Pattern

Interpreter pattern is a design pattern that specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language.
The basic idea is to have a class for each symbol(terminal or non-terminal) in a specialized computer language.
The syntax tree of a sentence in the language is an instance of the composite pattern
and is used to evaluate (interpret) the sentence for a client.
